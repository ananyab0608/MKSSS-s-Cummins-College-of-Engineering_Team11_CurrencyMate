💹 Currency Exchange Rate Analysis Dashboard

This project is a Currency Exchange Rate Dashboard that allows users to analyze exchange rates between two currencies over various time periods. The dashboard helps users visualize trends, compare currencies, and identify key dates when exchange rates peaked or hit their lowest point.

📊 Multiple Timeframes: View exchange rate data in weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly charts.
📈 Peak & Lowest Rates: Automatically detects and displays the highest and lowest exchange rates for the selected period.
🖨️ Print Option: Easily print the visualized data for reference or analysis.
🧮 Custom Currency Baskets: Create and manage custom currency baskets with user-defined weightage of currencies and calculate their aggregate value against a base currency.
⚠️ Risk Indicator: View fluctuation levels for selected currencies over the chosen period with the integrated volatility indicator.
